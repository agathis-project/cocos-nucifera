Design status at the time of release: a couple of nylon 3d prints were prototyped to prove the design and get the "look and feel" experience.

Expected future releases: 
  V0A - description of all required patches to release V0
  V1  - new piece part design including V1A patches to produce a machined aluminum prototype and small volume production
  V1A - description of all required patches to release V1
  V2  - new piece part design needed to execute an extrusion die for mass production
  
Updates to complete the design documentation, improve consistency or readability are done as needed; they are not distinct releases.
